Trying to demonstrate an issue with Webpack 3.* and stampit 3.*

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run webpack`
3. open the `index.html`

You will see an error, both on the page and in the console. What's interesting is that stampit works fine on Webpack 2, and if I
add `stampit` to `window` and access it from the console.
